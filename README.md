# Predicting Diabetes Outcomes

### Overview
Project aims to predict diabetes outcomes using the Pima Diabetes Database, employing Python for data preprocessing, modeling, and for exploratory data analysis and visualization. Key steps include data cleaning, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation using metrics like accuracy and AUC.

### Dataset
Leveraged the Kaggle ['Pima Indians Diabetes Database'](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database/data).

The variables presented are their insulin level, BMI, age, blood pressure, pregnancies, and a target variable, outcome.
